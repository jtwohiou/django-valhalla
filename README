django-valhalla was inspired by my desire to selectively log what was being
said on an IRC channel I've been involved in for most of my professional life.
The key word here is "selectively".  I knew there were plenty of IRC-logging
bots but let's face it, not everything that is typed is log worthy.

I figure this project could be used anywhere you want to record a tidbit of
data and associate it with a person and a timestamp.
